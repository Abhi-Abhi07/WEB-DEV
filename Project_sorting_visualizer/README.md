# Sorting Visualization

Welcome to the Sorting Visualization project! This interactive application visually demonstrates how various sorting algorithms work. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it is designed to enhance your understanding of algorithms through engaging animations.

## Supported Sorting Algorithms

- **Bubble Sort**: A simple comparison-based algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
  
- **Selection Sort**: This algorithm divides the input list into a sorted and an unsorted region and repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted region and moves it to the sorted region.
  
- **Insertion Sort**: A comparison-based algorithm that builds a sorted array one element at a time by repeatedly taking an element from the unsorted section and inserting it into the correct position in the sorted section.
  
- **Quick Sort**: A highly efficient sorting algorithm that employs a divide-and-conquer strategy by selecting a 'pivot' and partitioning the array into sub-arrays which are then sorted recursively.
  
- **Merge Sort**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the array into halves, recursively sorts them, and merges the sorted halves back together.

## Features

- **Visual Representation**: See how the algorithms work in real-time with animated bar graphs representing the array elements.
  
- **Dynamic Array Generation**: Generate random arrays of different sizes to visualize the sorting process with varying datasets.
  
- **Adjustable Speed**: Control the speed of the sorting animations to better observe the process.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the web application.
- **CSS**: For styling the application and enhancing user experience.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing sorting algorithms and enabling interactivity.
