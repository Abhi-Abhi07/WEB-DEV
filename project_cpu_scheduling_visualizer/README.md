# CPU Scheduling Algo visualizer

Welcome to the cpu scheduling Visualization project! This interactive application visually demonstrates how various cpu scheduling algorithms work. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it is designed to enhance your understanding of algorithms through engaging animations.

## Supported CPU Sheduling Algorithms

- **FCFS**: 
  
- **RR**: 
  
- **SJF**: 
  
- **SRTF**: 

- **Priority**: 

- **Preemptive-Priority**: 

  
## Features

- **Visual Representation**: See how the algorithms work in real-time with animated bar graphs representing the array elements.
  
  
- **Adjustable Speed**: Control the speed of the sorting animations to better observe the process.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the web application.
- **CSS**: For styling the application and enhancing user experience.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing cpu scheduling algorithms and enabling interactivity.
